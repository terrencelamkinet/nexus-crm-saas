"""NameCard crop pipeline — best-effort three-stage crop with OCR verification.

Stages (fast → slow, each returns a perspective-corrected card image):
  1. color_seeded  — LAB seed-connected mask (0.25s, robust to desk highlights)
  2. scanner       — Canny retry ladder + GrabCut fallback
  3. vision        — Qwen3-VL (SiliconFlow) four-corner detection

The caller (crm router) then runs verify_crop() from namecard_ocr: OCR of the
full original vs OCR of the crop. A crop that clipped card content loses
signal and is rejected — the original photo is kept instead.
