"""
Tenant middleware for FastAPI.

Extracts tenant_id from the JWT access token (Bearer auth header),
decodes it using decode_token from app.services.auth_service,
and stores the tenant_id in request.state.tenant_id.

If no token is present or the token is invalid, tenant_id is set
to an empty string so the request can continue (auth endpoints or
route-level dependencies can handle enforcement).

When a token is present but expired (valid structure, past expiry),
request.state.auth_status is set to "expired" so the router layer
can return an HTTP 401 instead of a misleading 403, which lets the
frontend's refresh flow kick in properly.

    Middleware that extracts tenant context from the JWT access token.

    Steps:
    1. Extract Bearer token from the Authorization header.
    2. If no token is present, skip (set tenant_id to "" and continue).
    3. Decode the token via decode_token to get tenant_id + user_id.
    4. Store tenant_id in request.state.tenant_id.
    5. If the token is invalid, set tenant_id to "" (no tenant context,
       request continues without failure).
    6. If the token is expired (valid signature but past exp), set
       request.state.auth_status = "expired" so routers return 401.
